      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm a passionate Software Developer with extensive experience in developing scalable web and mobile applications. My expertise spans a range of technologies including Angular, Flutter, EmberJS, React, Next.js, React Native, C/C++, JavaScript, Java, SQL, and NoSQL, enabling me to deliver innovative solutions across the information technology and services industry. I am particularly adept at leveraging Computer Vision and Machine Learning to enhance application functionality and user experience.

        Although my academic background includes a Master's degree in Cybersecurity from the Lebanese University - Faculty of Sciences, my professional journey has been more aligned with software development and engineering. This path has allowed me to build a robust portfolio of projects that demonstrate my ability to adapt to new technologies and methodologies in a rapidly evolving landscape.
        
        I am passionate about exploring cutting-edge frameworks and languages to stay ahead in the field, and I'm always looking for new challenges that push the boundaries of what's possible in software development.
